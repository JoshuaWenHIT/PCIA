## What is PCIA ?
![](data/images/graph_abstract.tif "graph abstract")
PCIA is an acronym for Pig Counting In Aisles. 
The purpose of this project is to continuously count the moving objects in the aisle in a fixed-view video scene, 
and specify the positive direction of movement, 
which means that the objects moving in the opposite direction should be counted down.
